## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client-side**: React.js application served statically
- **Server-side**: Node.js + Express API server connected to MongoDB
- **Communication**: RESTful API + WebSocket for real-time updates

### Database Schema

The main entities in the system are:

1. **Employee**: User accounts with roles (admin/employee) and fingerprint enrollment status
2. **Attendance**: Check-in/check-out records linked to employees, QR codes, or fingerprint IDs
3. **QRCode**: Generated QR codes with validity periods (legacy support)
4. **Fingerprint**: Biometric registration linking fingerprint IDs to employees
5. **Location**: Physical locations where attendance is tracked
6. **Settings**: System-wide configuration options

## API Endpoints

- **Quick Actions**: Fast access to common tasks like adding employees or generating QR codes
- **Recent Activity**: Real-time view of the latest check-ins and check-outs
- **Data Visualization**: Charts showing attendance trends and patterns
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for on-time, late, and absent employees

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment
1. Set up a production MongoDB database
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Deploy the Node.js application to your preferred hosting platform (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the React application:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the static files in the `build` folder to a web server or CDN

## Admin Account Setup

To create an initial admin account, use the `create-super-admin.js` script:

```bash
cd backend
node create-super-admin.js
```

Follow the prompts to create the first admin user.

## QR Code Generation

QR codes can be generated using the admin interface or the command-line script for testing:

```bash
cd backend
node generate-qrcode.js
```

QR codes contain encrypted information about:
- Location ID
- Timestamp of generation
- Unique identifier
- Expiration details

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are protected with JWT authentication
- Admin-only routes are protected with role-based middleware
- QR codes have expiration dates and can be deactivated
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks
- First-time login requires password change
- Session timeout for inactive users

## Mobile Responsiveness

The application is fully responsive and works well on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones (optimized for QR scanning)

## Mobile Connection Troubleshooting

When using the mobile app in a local network environment, you might encounter connection issues. The application includes built-in network diagnostics to help troubleshoot these problems:

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Same Network Requirement**: Ensure your mobile device and the server are connected to the same WiFi network
2. **Firewall Settings**: Check that your computer's firewall allows connections on ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend)
3. **Direct IP Connection**: For local networks, you may need to connect using the server's local IP address instead of localhost
4. **Network Diagnostics Tool**: Access the built-in network diagnostics by clicking the logo 5 times on the login screen

### Using the Network Diagnostics Feature

The application includes a special network diagnostics mode that helps identify and fix connection issues:

1. On the login screen, tap the logo icon 5 times quickly
2. Review the connection details displayed
3. Follow the suggested fixes for your specific connection problem
4. Use the "Diagnose Connection Issues" option when prompted for more detailed analysis

## Local Network Setup

To optimize the application for use in a local network environment:

1. Run the backend server script:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run start-network
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run start-network
   ```

3. These scripts will automatically configure the correct IP addresses for your local network environment

## Future Enhancements

- **Geofencing**: Restrict check-ins to specific geographic boundaries
- **Biometric Integration**: Add support for fingerprint or facial recognition
- **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled email reports to administrators
- **Leave Management**: Integrate with vacation and sick leave tracking
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android
- **Webhooks**: Integration with third-party HR and payroll systems
