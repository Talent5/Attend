# Email Validation in Attend System

The Attend system implements robust email validation to ensure only real, valid email addresses are used for accounts. This document describes the validation process and how it works.

## Validation Features

1. **Format Validation**: Ensures email addresses follow standard formatting rules
2. **Disposable Email Detection**: Prevents the use of temporary or disposable email services
3. **Domain Verification**: Validates that the email domain has valid MX records (can receive emails)

## Validation Layers

The system implements multiple validation layers:

### Client-Side Validation
- Immediate feedback as users type their email address
- Warnings for potentially invalid domains
- Checks against common disposable email providers

### Server-Side Validation
- Comprehensive middleware for validating emails
- Checks email format using regex patterns
- Verifies email domain has valid MX records
- Blocks common disposable email domains

## Disposable Email Protection

The system maintains a list of known disposable email domains that are blocked from registration. This helps ensure that only legitimate users with real email addresses can register accounts.

## Domain MX Record Verification

Beyond simple format validation, the system checks if the email domain has valid MX records, indicating it can actually receive email. This prevents fake domains or mistyped domains from being used.

## Error Messages

The system provides clear, user-friendly error messages when email validation fails, helping users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

## Configuration

The email validation system is configurable and can be extended as needed:
- Add or remove domains from the disposable email list
- Adjust validation rules as requirements change
- Configure error messages for different validation issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements may include:
- Email verification via confirmation link
- SMTP validation to check if mailbox exists
- Additional heuristics to detect suspicious email patterns
